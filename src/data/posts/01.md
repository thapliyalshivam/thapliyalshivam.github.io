You notice how some people you work with have a very astute and mostly correct intuition about a variety of user scenarios, behaviours and product performance?

I always wondered what such a spot on intuition was grounded in. So I talked about it with a few colleagues and dug deep.

## 1. Have a dashboard
The larger a product’s user base, the more diverse cohorts it contains. When you build a product for a massive user base (billions of users), you have more likelihood of your intuition working well because chances are that a fair percentage of the use base are people like you. We see this a lot in Search — **practically everyone who uses the internet uses Search and hence you can safely assume that many of the users think and act like you do.**

Now imagine a different situation where you are building a [link text](http://dev.nodeca.com) product for a very specific user base, for example, the retired elderly people in Europe — your intuitions are going to be completely off. You have no idea how to think about them other than a few very basic (largely inaccurate) assumptions.

Because most products target a specific user base, we need to go through the process of intuition calibration in order to be effective at building products for them.


#### The tasks for the lists are as follows

- [x] @mentions, #refs, [links](), **formatting**, and <del>tags</del> supported
- [x] list syntax required (any unordered or ordered list supported)
- [x] this is a complete item
- [ ] this is an incomplete item
