# Product Intuition Calibration

You notice how some people you work with have a very astute and mostly correct intuition about a variety of user scenarios, behaviours and product performance?

I always wondered what such a spot on intuition was grounded in. So I talked about it with a few colleagues and dug deep.



## 1. User cohort & intuition


The larger a product’s user base, the more diverse cohorts it contains. When you build a product for a massive user base (billions of users), you have more likelihood of your intuition working well because chances are that a fair percentage of the use base are people like you. We see this a lot in Search — **practically everyone who uses the internet uses Search and hence you can safely assume that many of the users think and act like you do.**

Now imagine a different situation where you are building a [link text](http://dev.nodeca.com) product for a very specific user base, for example, the retired elderly people in Europe — your intuitions are going to be completely off. You have no idea how to think about them other than a few very basic (largely inaccurate) assumptions.

Because most products target a specific user base, we need to go through the process of intuition calibration in order to be effective at building products for them.






#### The tasks for the lists are as follows

- [x] @mentions, #refs, [links](), **formatting**, and <del>tags</del> supported
- [x] list syntax required (any unordered or ordered list supported)
- [x] this is a complete item
- [ ] this is an incomplete item

## Lists

Unordered

+ Create a list by starting a line with `+`, `-`, or `*`
+ Sub-lists are made by indenting 2 spaces:
  - Marker character change forces new list start:
    * Ac tristique libero volutpat at
    + Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet
    - Nulla volutpat aliquam velit
+ Very easy!

Ordered

1. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
2. Consectetur adipiscing elit
3. Integer molestie lorem at massa


1. You can use sequential numbers...
1. ...or keep all the numbers as `1.`

Start numbering with offset:

57. foo
1. bar

## Code

Inline `code`

Indented code

    // Some comments
    line 1 of code
    line 2 of code
    line 3 of code


Block code "fences"

```
Sample text here...
```

Syntax highlighting

``` js
var foo = function (bar) {
  return bar++;
};

console.log(foo(5));
```
